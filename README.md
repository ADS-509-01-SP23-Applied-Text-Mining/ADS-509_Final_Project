## Project Description
We are looking at Cornell University’s arXiv (open access archive) of scholarly articles. The website has 2,200,384 scholarly articles in various fields of study, though primarily in STEM and financial fields. We will focus on titles and abstracts then collect key words from those instead of entire articles.
